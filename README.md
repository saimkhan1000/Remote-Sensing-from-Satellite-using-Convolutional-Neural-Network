# Remote-Sensing-from-Satellite-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
The project focuses on Remote Sensing using Satellite images with CNNs and EuroSat dataset

In this project we will work with the EuroSAT dataset.1 The EuroSAT dataset is based
on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and consisting of 10 classes with
27 000 labeled and geo-referenced samples. Two datasets are available. RGB contains
only the frequency bands corresponding to red, green, and blue channels encoded as JPEG
images. All contains all 13 frequency bands available in the original satellite images. The
class labels are: AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture,
PermanentCrop, Residential, River and SeaLake.

We will make our own 2 Deep Learning Models and check the accuracy.
